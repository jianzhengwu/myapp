#Creating a Run Configuration

In order to make life easier you can create a run configuration for express.

Click Run -> Run Configurations -> Manage ...

Click Add New Config

In the run panel fill in Express as name, bin/www as the command and Node 0.10.x as the runner.

clicking Set As Default. 

If you do so then clicking the run button will always run the app and not the currently opened file.
